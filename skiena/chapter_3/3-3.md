# Problme 3-3: 

## Statement

Dynamic arrays enable arraws to grow while achieving constant-time amortized performance. 

### Part 1: Given a strategy where we halve the size of array when the utilization < 50%.

Show a sequnce of insertions and deltions where this strategy gives a bad amortized cost. 

### Part 2: Give a better underflow strategy than the above
