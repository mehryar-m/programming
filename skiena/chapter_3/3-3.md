# Problme 3-3: 

## Statement

Dynamic arrays enable arrays to grow while achieving constant-time amortized performance. 

### Background: How do arrays enable achieving constant-time amortized performance? 

### Part 1: Given a strategy where we halve the size of array when the utilization < 50%.

Show a sequnce of insertions and deltions where this strategy gives a bad amortized cost. 

```
[]
insert(1)
[1]
insert(2)
[1,2]
insert(3)
[1,2,3,_]
delete(3)
[1,2,_,_]
[1,2]
insert(3)
```
Once you get to 3 elements of a 4 element array. Insert and delete.

### Part 2: Give a better underflow strategy than the above

Cut by half when the array is 1/4 full.
